2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on EBLU relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CKM.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on EGRN relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CKM.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on ERED relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of CKM.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#1 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/sdat_reg[31]/Q and design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/QCNT_reg[28]/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#2 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/sdat_reg[32]/Q and design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/QCNT_reg[29]/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#3 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/sdat_reg[33]/Q and design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/QCNT_reg[30]/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#4 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/sdat_reg[34]/Q and design_1_i/GREGBLK_PS_0/inst/xecnt/QCNT_reg[31]/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>
